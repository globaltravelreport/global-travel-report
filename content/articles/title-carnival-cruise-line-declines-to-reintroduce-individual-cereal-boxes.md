Cruise ships are known for their copious amounts of food offerings, designed to cater to every palate. However, it appears that one passenger's request for a return to individual boxed cereals has been refused by the Carnival Cruise Line. The passenger, who voiced their displeasure to Brand Ambassador, John Heald, felt that these boxes were a convenient snack option, especially for their children.

The passenger lamented, "Why are the small individual boxes of cereals not available in the buffet at breakfast? My kids like to snack on these throughout the day, so it would be convenient to grab a few each morning before going ashore." The passenger was particularly disappointed that the Carnival Paradise only offered cereal from a hotel-style dispenser, forcing them to resort to smuggling cereal off the ship in zip lock bags.

John Heald confirmed that the company did once offer small cereal boxes, saying, "We do have cereal from dispensers now, and yes, we used to have them in those small boxes, but people would take many of them. Not just for breakfast, but to take back to their cabins or even to take home, and it was simply not practical."

The passenger insisted on the return of these boxes, arguing that everybody eats cereal. However, Heald pointed out that not everyone shares this preference, noting that even if the boxes were affordable at a grocery store, the sheer volume required to feed the 2,124 guests aboard the Carnival Paradise would be staggering, not to mention the additional waste generated by these boxes.

Furthermore, the suggestion to 'smuggle' cereal off the ship raises issues with local laws at the ports the cruise line visits. Heald warned, "Most of the places we go do not allow this. If you are caught by local authorities bringing food off the ship, they may not take kindly to it."

In conclusion, despite the convenience these individual cereal boxes may offer to some, their return to Carnival Cruise Line's breakfast buffet is unlikely. Passengers will have to adapt to the current offerings or consider bringing their own snacks onboard.
