Explore Copenhagen with New Direct Flights Perfect for Australian Travellers

Australia's wanderlust for unique international experiences is about to get a significant boost, thanks to China Eastern Airlines. The airline's recent announcement to add flights to Copenhagen opens up a new realm of Scandinavian adventures for Aussie explorers. This route not only promises an efficient journey but also bridges the cultural gap between the Australian sun and the Nordic charm.

Flight Routes and Connections

For Australians itching to swap the Southern Hemisphere's sun for Denmark's hygge, connecting flights through major Chinese hubs now offer a streamlined path. Starting from Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane, travellers can find themselves in Copenhagen with just one stop, making the world seem a bit smaller.

Price Comparisons in AUD

Budgeting for international travel is always a concern, but the introduction of this route is competitive. While prices will fluctuate, early birds can snag tickets from approximately 1,200 AUD, a fair deal for those planning ahead.

When to Visit

Timing your visit can dramatically change your Danish experience. For Aussies looking to escape the winter blues, Denmark's summer (June to August) offers long days and mild temperatures. Conversely, visiting during the Australian summer lets you experience Denmark's cozy winter and the chance to see the Northern Lights.

Visa Requirements

Good news for Australian passport holders â€“ Denmark allows visa-free entry for up to 90 days within a 180-day period. This makes spontaneous trips and long-planned adventures equally feasible.

Cultural Insights and Travel Tips

Adjusting to Denmark's culture comes with its quirks for Australians. The Danes value punctuality and straightforward communication, which can be a shift from the laid-back Aussie demeanor. Remember to embrace the local etiquette, and you'll find a warm welcome.

Practical Travel Information

Denmark's currency is the Danish Krone (DKK), and while credit cards are widely accepted, having some cash for small purchases is advisable. Copenhagen boasts an efficient public transport system, making it easy to explore beyond the city limits. Accommodation options are plentiful, but booking in advance can save you some Kroner, especially during peak seasons.
