How about we chat about my latest find in the world of travel newsletters? Meet Daily Drop, the brainchild of my mates Kara and Nate. You might know them from their smashing YouTube channel. This free newsletter is a goldmine for those smitten with points, miles, and all things travel. But there's more: they've whipped up something called Daily Drop Pro that promises to throw even more deals your way. 

Now, you're probably scratching your head thinking "Is it worth it?" As this service has grown legs, I've had quite a few folks asking about its value. So, here's me taking the plunge to dissect this beast for you.

So what's under the hood of Daily Drop Pro? It wants to be your go-to hub for sniffing out flights and hotel deals (either on points or cold hard cash), while also giving you a platform to chinwag with other travel aficionados in their community forum. Five main features take centre stage here: Flight Points Search, Hotel Points Search, Deal Alerts, Wallets and Daily Drop Pro Lounge.

Let's get our hands dirty and explore each one.

Flight Points Search - A sea of websites already offer point flight searches; among them are Point.me, Seats.aero and Points Path. Yet what makes Daily Drop stand out from this packed crowd? Apart from allowing you to narrow down results based on time slots or aircraft type (a unique feature by the way), it really shines when you want specifics regarding award flights. Ain’t no other service nailing these details like they do!

Hotel Points Searches - Now this is where the plot thickens! The competition isn't fierce in this realm - yet -, but Daily Drops offers an extensive list of customizable options based on points or certain programs; heck, they'll even show you which credit cards you can transfer points from. You really feel like you're in the driver's seat with this one!

So, is Daily Drop Pro worth a dabble? I'd say, why not! With its user-friendly interface and treasure trove of customizable options, it could just be the tool you need to level up your travel game.
