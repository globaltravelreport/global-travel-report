- Local Transport: Embrace the local way of getting around, whether it's by tuk-tuk, bullet train, or scooter. It's not only economical but also adds an authentic twist to your travel adventures.

- Accommodation: Asia's accommodation options are as diverse as its cultures. From budget hostels to five-star resorts, there's something for every taste and budget. Booking in advance can secure you the best deals.
