In a move that's sure to excite Australian globetrotters, China Eastern Airlines is expanding its wings with new flights to Copenhagen. This addition is not just about expanding their network but opening up a seamless pathway for Australians looking to explore the enchanting city of Copenhagen. 

For Australians, navigating the journey to Copenhagen has just gotten easier. China Eastern's new route means that travelers can now find more direct flights from major Australian cities, connecting through key hubs, and landing in the heart of Denmark. This cuts down on travel time significantly, making it an attractive option for those keen to explore Europe.

Price-wise, Australians will find the fares competitive, with prices in AUD often varying depending on the season. Early birds can snag deals that make this European adventure more accessible than ever. Speaking of timing, the best times to visit Copenhagen from Australia are during the Australian winter months – June to August – when Denmark basks in its summery glory. It's a perfect escape from the cold back home.

Australian passport holders will need to check current visa requirements, but typically, a Schengen visa is required for stays up to 90 days. It's advisable to sort this well in advance of your travel dates.

Cultural differences are part of the charm when traveling from Australia to Copenhagen. Australians will find Danes to be quite reserved but friendly once you break the ice. English is widely spoken, which eases communication, but learning a few Danish phrases can go a long way in making a good impression.

Practical travel information for Australians includes getting around, which in Copenhagen, is a breeze thanks to its efficient public transport system. The currency is the Danish Krone (DKK), and while Denmark can be pricier than Australia, there are budget-friendly accommodation options and dining choices that cater to all wallets.

In summary, the new flight route from China Eastern Airlines is a game-changer for Australian travelers looking to explore Copenhagen. It offers a direct, affordable, and convenient way to dive into the Danish culture, with the best travel times coinciding with the Australian winter. Just remember to check visa requirements and get ready to embrace the cultural nuances of this charming city.
