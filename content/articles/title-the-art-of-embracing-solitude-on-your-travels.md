There's a funny thing about travel - we all seem to have these grand images in our heads, painted by fanciful stories and glamorous movies, don't we? I remember back in 2006 before my first big trip. I was convinced it'd be non-stop excitement. I'd be chatting up with strangers on buses and swapping stories with charismatic locals over drinks, maybe even getting some French lessons from a beautiful waitress under the soft glow of a wine bar. It was supposed to be an adventure ripped straight from the pages of those glossy travel magazines or films.

So then there I was, wandering through historic cities, checking out all sorts of unique attractions at my own pace. You know that feeling when you realise you're truly free? That was me. Marching to my drum - no schedules, no commitments. Those first few days were such a whirlwind that being alone didn't even cross my mind.

But here's the kicker - as time went on and my chatterbox tendencies were reduced to mere whispers, that initial thrills evaporated quicker than water in the Aussie outback! Suddenly that freedom became isolation. Loneliness had sneaked up on me like a dingo stalking its prey.

It got me thinking - where were all those friendly locals who were going to show me their city secrets? Where were those crazy adventurers with whom I'd share late-night escapades? And before long this niggling thought crept into my mind – "maybe it's not them…maybe it's just me."

And let's face it; sometimes we are our worst enemies aren't we? We get so caught up in fear that we tie ourselves down. As someone who leans more towards introversion (believe it or not!), striking up conversations with random folks doesn't come naturally to me. This struggle felt amplified during my early travel days, and I reckon it's something that still lurks around from time to time.

But I realised that if I wanted the travel experience that was playing on repeat in my mind, I had to actively invite it into existence. After all, life doesn't just hand you what you want on a silver platter does it? You've got to reach out and grab it!

So how did this loner finally crack the code of travelling alone without feeling lonely? An unexpected encounter in Prague. There were these folks at my hostel who made the first move - they sparked up a conversation with me. It was like they'd pried open an invisible barrier that fear had constructed around me.

From then onwards, things started falling into place. Conversations weren't as daunting as I'd hyped them up to be and people were way more friendly than expected! The thing is, there are plenty of solo travellers out there looking for interactions just like you and me; we're not the lone rangers we think we are!

And hey, if an introverted Aussie bloke can navigate his way through solitude in travel - you bet your boots anyone else can too! All you need is a bit of courage, some faith in yourself and the willingness to seize opportunities when they knock on your door.
