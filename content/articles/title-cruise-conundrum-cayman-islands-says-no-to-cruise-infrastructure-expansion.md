In an apparent setback for cruising enthusiasts, the citizens of the Cayman Islands have voiced their verdict against the expansion of cruise infrastructure. A proposal spearheaded by the Association for Advancement of Cruise Tourism (ACT) in Grand Cayman, advocating for a significant upgrade to the cruise infrastructure, was met with a resounding 'no' from voters in 2025.

The voting, which took place on April 30, 2025, witnessed approximately 64% of the 11,973 voters rejecting the proposed development of cruise berthing infrastructure. Only 5,417 voters expressed their support for the project. The proposed expansion, had it been approved, would have seen the construction of two new piers capable of accommodating up to four ships simultaneously, including larger vessels such as Royal Caribbean’s Oasis-class ships, which currently cannot dock at the Cayman's tender-only port.

The proposed investment also encompassed the development of a new cruise terminal, additional retail spaces, and a transportation area, aimed at attracting more attention from major cruise lines. The project, estimated at a cost of $150 to $200 million, would have been partially funded by Carnival Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean.

However, the activist group Cruise Port Referendum (CPR) Cayman opposed the port proposal throughout the campaign, expressing concerns over the impacts of increased cruise ship visits on the quality of life for the 73,038 residents of the Cayman Islands. They posited that the existing infrastructure needed improvement before any expansion could take place.

In the wake of the vote, a spokesperson for CPR Cayman stated, "Cayman has VOTED NO. In the 30 April 2025 referendum, 64% of voters said NO to cruise berthing infrastructure — a clear message that Caymanians support a smarter, more sustainable path forward. This is a win for our economy, our environment and our way of life." The group's victory underscores the island's commitment to sustainable tourism and the preservation of its unique lifestyle and environment.

Conclusion
In summary, while cruising continues to grow in popularity, the residents of the Cayman Islands have made it clear that they prefer a more sustainable and thoughtful approach to tourism. As the debate over expanding cruise infrastructure continues globally, the Cayman Islands' decision will likely influence future discussions in other popular cruise destinations.
