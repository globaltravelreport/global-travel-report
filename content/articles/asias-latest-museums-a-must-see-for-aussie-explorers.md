As Australian wanderlust continues to grow, two new museums in Asia are sparking interest among cultural enthusiasts and art lovers. These destinations not only offer a deep dive into rich histories and contemporary art but are also easily accessible from major Australian cities, making them perfect additions to your travel bucket list.

First up, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Tokyo has recently unveiled an extensive renovation. Direct flights from Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane to Tokyo are plentiful, with round-trip fares typically ranging from $800 to $1,200 AUD depending on the season. The best times to visit, considering Australian seasons, are during Australia’s autumn or spring, aligning with Japan’s cherry blossom season and autumn foliage. Australians can enter Japan without a visa for short stays, making this an even more appealing destination. The museum is located conveniently in central Tokyo, with a multitude of accommodation options nearby to suit all budgets, from luxury hotels to more affordable guesthouses. The local currency is the Japanese Yen, and the city boasts an efficient public transport system, ideal for exploring.

Next, the Yayoi Kusama Museum in Singapore presents a vibrant showcase of the iconic artist's work. Singapore Airlines and Qantas offer direct flights from Sydney, Melbourne, and Perth, with prices hovering around $500 to $700 AUD return. Singapore’s tropical climate means it’s a year-round destination, but visiting during the Australian winter offers a warm escape. Australian passport holders can enjoy visa-free entry, adding to the hassle-free experience. The museum is situated in the heart of Singapore, surrounded by a plethora of dining and accommodation options. The Singapore Dollar is the currency, and the city’s public transport system is both affordable and comprehensive, ensuring easy navigation.

For Australian travelers, these museums not only provide a cultural feast but also offer practical travel benefits such as visa-free entry and a variety of flight options. Remember, Japan and Singapore have relatively conservative cultures, so mindful dressing and behavior are advised. Also, English is widely spoken in Singapore, whereas in Japan, having a translation app or learning basic phrases can enhance your experience.
