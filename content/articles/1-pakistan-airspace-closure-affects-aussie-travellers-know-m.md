Australian Travellers Face Longer Routes to India Amid Pakistan Airspace Closure

For Australians planning a journey to India or its surrounding regions, recent developments require a closer look at your travel plans. Pakistan's decision to close its airspace to Indian airlines has sparked a significant reroute for flights, potentially affecting travel times and costs for Australians heading in that direction.

Flight Routes and Connections

Typically, the most straightforward routes from major Australian cities to India involve transiting through Southeast Asian hubs like Singapore or Kuala Lumpur. However, with the airspace closure, travellers might find themselves on longer, possibly more expensive routes. Direct flights, or those with minimal layovers, are now taking a detour, adding to both the journey time and the carbon footprint.

Cost Implications

The detour could see an increase in ticket prices due to the longer flight paths. For context, a return flight from Sydney to New Delhi that used to cost around AUD 1,200 might see a hike of 10-20%, depending on the airline and the season. Early booking and flexibility with travel dates can still snag you a deal closer to the original price range.

Best Times to Visit

Considering Australia's seasons, the ideal time to visit India is during our spring (September to November) or autumn (March to May). These periods avoid the extreme heat of the Indian summer and the heavy monsoon rains, making your travel experience more comfortable.

Visa Requirements

Australian passport holders need to apply for a visa before travelling to India, which can be done online. The e-Visa process is straightforward, with fees costing approximately AUD 80 for a tourist visa valid for a year with multiple entries allowed.

Cultural Differences and Travel Tips

Cultural sensitivity is crucial while travelling in India. Dress modestly, especially when visiting religious sites, and be prepared for a vibrant array of traditions and customs. English is widely spoken, but learning a few phrases in Hindi can enrich your experience.

Practical Travel Information

The Indian Rupee (INR) is the local currency, with AUD 1 typically converting to around 50 INR. Local transport varies from rickshaws and taxis to modern metro systems in larger cities. Accommodation options range from budget hostels at around AUD 15 a night to luxury hotels upwards of AUD 150. Always ensure you have access to clean drinking water and take precautions with street food to avoid Delhi belly.
