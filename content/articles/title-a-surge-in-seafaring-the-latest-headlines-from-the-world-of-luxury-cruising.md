At the heart of this week's news is the Port of Vancouver, British Columbia, a prime launch point and port of call for Alaska cruises, which is preparing for a prosperous season. The season, which started in early March and continues until early October, is set to welcome a staggering 300-plus ships. With an estimated 1.2 million passenger transits, this influx promises a buoyant boost for the region's cruise tourism industry.

In 2025, the port is set to host seventy-four cruises, with up to 50,000 passengers anticipated to transit the port during peak weekends. Each ship visit contributes approximately $3 million in direct local spending, signalling a potentially prosperous year for the local economy. 

Despite the impressive figures this year, the Canada Place cruise terminal in Vancouver has seen even higher numbers. In 2024, it welcomed 1.32 million passengers from 327 cruise ship calls, a figure slightly higher than this year's projections. Nevertheless, port officials are looking forward to the season, particularly as several ships will be making their maiden calls.

In conclusion, the cruise industry is set to sail ahead with a vibrant year of activity in 2025, especially at the Port of Vancouver. As we steer into this exciting era of seafaring, stay tuned to our updates for all the major developments in the world of luxury cruising.
