In a remarkable turn of events, the residents of the scenic Cayman Islands have collectively decided against the expansion of cruise infrastructure. The decision, resulting from a public vote, may not be well-received by cruise enthusiasts worldwide.

The Association for Advancement of Cruise Tourism (ACT) in Grand Cayman had invested significant effort to put forward a proposition for expanding the island's cruise infrastructure in the 2025 ballot. However, the proposal eventually met with rejection. The public referendum held on April 30, 2025, saw a majority of 11,973 voters, comprising around 64% of the total votes, firmly respond 'no' to the question, "Should the Cayman Islands develop cruise berthing infrastructure?". In contrast, a mere 5,417 voters marked 'yes'.

The proposed plan, if approved, would have seen the construction of two new piers capable of accommodating up to four vessels simultaneously, including larger cruise ships like the Royal Caribbeanâ€™s Oasis-class vessels that currently cannot dock at the tender-only port. Moreover, a new cruise terminal, retail spaces, and a transportation area were on the cards, aiming to attract more attention from major cruise lines. The budget was estimated to be between $150 and $200 million, with contributions from Carnival Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean.

Despite these promising prospects, the Cruise Port Referendum (CPR) Cayman, an activist group, staunchly opposed the port proposal. They argued that the current infrastructure needed improvements before expansion. Furthermore, they expressed concerns over the potential impact of increased cruise ship calls on the quality of life for the 73,038 residents of the Cayman Islands.

In conclusion, the decision by the Cayman Islands to reject cruise infrastructure expansion is a testament to the community's commitment to sustainable development and quality of life over tourism growth. The result demonstrates how vital it is for the tourism industry to strike a balance between economic gain and preserving local communities' way of life.
