Prague, with its enchanting streets and majestic historical sites, has always been a bucket-list destination for many. Now, it's even more appealing for Australian travelers with the opening of Prague's newest luxury hotel. As a travel journalist and SEO expert, I've gathered all the essential info to make your Czech vacation as splendid and hassle-free as possible.

Flight Routes and Connections: Direct flights from Australia to Europe are a rarity, making at least one stopover a necessity. Major Australian cities like Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane offer various routes to Prague, usually connecting through Middle Eastern or Asian hubs. Flight times can average from 23 to 30 hours depending on your departure point and layovers. 

Price Comparisons in AUD: The cost of a European escapade can vary. However, staying at Prague's newest luxury hotel offers value for money, with prices starting from approximately 300 AUD per night, offering a blend of opulence and the charm of Czech culture. 

Best Times to Visit: To avoid the sweltering Australian summer and the European winter, the best time to visit Prague is during the Australian autumn (March to May) or spring (September to November). These months offer mild weather in Prague and fewer tourists.

Visa Requirements: Australian passport holders can breathe easy as the Czech Republic is part of the Schengen Area, allowing tourists to enter visa-free for up to 90 days within a 180 day period. Just make sure your passport has at least six months' validity from your planned date of return.

Cultural Differences and Travel Tips: Czech culture values politeness and a bit of formality. When entering shops or restaurants, a simple "Dobr√Ω den" (Good day) can go a long way. Tipping is also customary, with about 10% being the norm for good service. 

Practical Travel Information: The Czech Republic uses the Czech koruna (CZK), and though some places accept Euros, it's best to have local currency. Credit cards are widely accepted in Prague, especially in this new luxury hotel. For getting around, Prague boasts an efficient public transport system including metro, trams, and buses. However, much of the city's beauty can be best explored on foot.
