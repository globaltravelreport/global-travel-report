Thailand Beckons Aussie Explorers with the Launch of Star Voyager

Gone are the days of complicated travel plans for Aussies looking to explore the vibrant culture, stunning beaches, and bustling markets of Thailand. With the introduction of Star Voyager by StarDream Cruises, in collaboration with the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT), Aussies now have a luxurious and hassle-free way to discover the Land of Smiles.

Seamless Connections from Down Under

For travelers embarking from major Australian cities such as Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane, Thailand has never been more accessible. Direct flights frequently jet off to Bangkok, offering a range of prices to suit any budget. Once in Thailand, the Star Voyager awaits to whisk you away on an unforgettable journey. For a rough price comparison, a round-trip flight can cost anywhere from 700 to 1,200 AUD depending on the season and how far in advance you book.

When to Set Sail

Timing your voyage is crucial. The best times to visit Thailand from Australia are during the Aussie winter months, from June to August, when Thailand boasts pleasant weather, perfect for cruising and island hopping. It's also a fantastic way to escape the Australian cold and soak up some tropical sun.

Visa Information

Australian passport holders can breathe easy knowing they are eligible for a visa exemption upon arrival in Thailand for stays of up to 30 days. This makes spur-of-the-moment decisions to set sail even easier.

Cultural Insights and Travel Tips

Thailand's rich cultural tapestry and warm hospitality can be quite a change from the Australian way of life. Respectful attire in temples, understanding the importance of the monarchy, and mastering the wai (Thai greeting) will go a long way in earning the respect of the locals.

Navigating Your Journey

The Thai Baht (THB) is the local currency, and while ATMs are plentiful, carrying some cash is advisable for smaller purchases, especially on remote islands. Local transport varies from tuk-tuks to more comfortable taxis, but on Star Voyager, all your transport needs are taken care of with style and luxury.

Accommodation options in Thailand range from beachfront bungalows to five-star hotels. However, the Star Voyager offers sumptuous suites that mean you might never want to leave the ship!
