As Australian wanderlust continues to grow, seeking out lesser-trodden paths has become the new trend. For those looking to escape the usual tourist traps in 2025, here are five underrated destinations that promise adventure, culture, and a touch of the unique, all tailored for the Aussie explorer.

Valparaíso, Chile
Escape to the vibrant streets of Valparaíso, where art and culture collide in a stunning display of graffiti and hillside ascensores. Direct flights from Sydney to Santiago are followed by a scenic bus ride to this coastal gem. Best visited during the Australian winter (Chile’s summer), you’ll enjoy mild temperatures and festive atmospheres. Australians can enter Chile without a visa for up to 90 days, making this an accessible escape. Budget around AUD 3,000 for a two-week trip, including flights and accommodation.

Tallinn, Estonia
Step into the fairy tale town of Tallinn, a blend of medieval charm and digital modernity. With flights from major Australian cities connecting in Dubai or Doha, Tallinn is a summer getaway like no other, offering cool, comfortable weather in contrast to Australia’s winter chill. Visa-free for Aussies, Estonia presents an affordable European experience, with costs averaging AUD 2,500 for a fortnight’s stay.

George Town, Malaysia
A foodie’s paradise, George Town offers a melting pot of cultures and cuisines. Affordable flights are available from Australian capitals, with a short layover in Southeast Asian hubs. Visiting during Australia’s summer provides a tropical escape from January to March. Australian passport holders can enjoy Malaysia visa-free for up to 90 days. Budget roughly AUD 1,800 for two weeks, including airfare.

Ljubljana, Slovenia
Ljubljana, a city that prides itself on green spaces and a car-free city center, offers a refreshing European getaway. Flights from Australia typically connect in Middle Eastern or Asian hubs. Spring (Australia’s autumn) is ideal, with lush landscapes and mild weather. Australians can stay visa-free for up to 90 days in Slovenia. Expect to spend about AUD 2,800 for a two-week vacation.

Dakar, Senegal
Embark on an African adventure to Dakar, where the Atlantic meets vibrant street markets and French-African fusion cuisine. While flights from Australia require at least one stop, typically in the Middle East, the journey unveils a rich tapestry of music, art, and history. Visiting during Australia’s summer offers warm, dry days, ideal for exploring. Senegal allows visa-free entry for Australians for up to 90 days. Plan for an expenditure of around AUD 3,500 for two weeks.

Travel Tips for Australians
