<p>Finding the best travel deals is a matter of timing.</p>
<p>A lot of people think travel is just expensive, but in reality, there are incredible deals happening all the time. They often don’t last too long, and you have to act quickly. That can sometimes be a problem when a deal requires jumping on a plane tomorrow (how many people can do that?).</p>
<p>Fortunately, most deals are for months in the future, giving you ample time to plan your schedule.</p>
<p>Often I will book a flight and <em>then</em> figure out my plans. </p>
<p>Since you can usually cancel a flight within 24 hours without incurring a fee, I lock in the deal and then figure out if I can make it work. Sometimes I can (like the $1,200 USD business-class flight from <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/united-states-travel-guide/los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LA</a> to <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/sweden-travel-tips/stockholm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stockholm</a> round-trip); sometimes I can’t (like the $400 USD <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/new-zealand-travel-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Zealand</a> flights I had to cancel).</p>
<p>I am always looking out for deals.</p>
<p>Today, I want to tell you where I go for travel deals, tips, and expert advice. After all, these resources focus solely on this one aspect of travel, so why not use them? I can’t know everything, so I rely on specialists. If travel were a hospital, I would be your general practitioner. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick look at the top companies I use and suggest:</p>

<h3>Where to Find the Best Flight Deals</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2023/planeinterior.jpg" alt="Rows of seats in an airplane" width="675" height="395" /><br />
When it comes to finding flight deals, I use these four websites for last-minute deals. There are always finding new (and tempting) last minute flights — often for a fraction of what you would pay otherwise. </p>
<p>My go-to website for cheap flight deals is <a href="https://going.sjv.io/9WNaj0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Going.com</a>. Formerly Scott&#8217;s Cheap Flights, this is an awesome resource for finding flight deals from the US. They offer free flight alerts, and with a <a href="https://going.sjv.io/9WNaj0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">premium membership</a> you get access to even more deals as soon as they find them. (New users can get 20% off Premium with the code NOMADICMATT20.)</p>
<p>Three other great websites to use are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.theflightdeal.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Flight Deal</a> – This is a great resource for finding cheap flights from the USA. If you&#8217;re based in the States, start your research here!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.secretflying.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Secret Flying</a> – This cheap flight website finds &#8220;error fares&#8221; (when airlines make pricing mistakes) to and from destinations all around the globe.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.holidaypirates.com/flights" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Holiday Pirates</a> – No matter where you&#8217;re based this is a great cheap flight website so be sure to always check here for more deals.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re simply looking to book a flight, check out the search engines below. It&#8217;s important to remember that there is no <em>one</em> best online booking website. All the search engine websites have blind spots so it&#8217;s important to search a few different places before you book your flight. </p>
<p>Generally, the BEST booking sites are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://skyscanner.pxf.io/c/214481/1027991/13416?subId1=%26currency%3DUSD&#038;associateid=AFF_TRA_19354_00001&#038;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skyscanner.com%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skyscanner</a> &#8211; I always start my searches with Skyscanner. It&#8217;s a very intuitive platform that searches booking websites and airlines all around the world to ensure that no deal is missed. If you&#8217;re not 100% sure where you want to go (or when) then start your search with Skyscanner.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/travel/flights" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Google Flights</a> &#8211; A good all-around flight search website to include in your cheap flight arsenal.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Where to Find the Best Points &#038; Miles News</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/pointmereview.jpeg" width="675" height="395" alt="Nomadic Matt enjoying a first class seat while flying around the world"><br />
When it comes to finding the latest in airline and frequent flier news, I turn to these sites. They give me the latest on the changes in the industry and loyalty programs, and any points and miles news that might be important:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://viewfromthewing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View from the Wing</a> &#8211; This is where I go for airline and frequent flier news.</li>
<li><a href="https://thepointsguy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Points Guy</a> &#8211; A great resource for credit card and points &#038; miles news and information.</li>
<li><a href="https://onemileatatime.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One Mile at a Time</a> &#8211; This is a great website for credit card, in-flight experiences, and frequent flier news.</li>
</ul>
<p>For Australia and New Zealand, visit <a href="https://www.pointhacks.com.au" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Points Hack</a>.</p>
<p>For Canada, use <a href="https://princeoftravel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prince of Travel</a>.</p>
<p>For the UK, <a href="http://www.headforpoints.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Head for Points</a>.</p>
<p>As a very, very, very avid traveler (and while <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/product/guide-to-points-and-miles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I have my own special tricks and tips</a>), when you’re overseas a lot, it&#8217;s hard to stay up to date on your own so I use these three sites to keep me in the loop.</p>

<h3>Where to Find the Best Cruise Deals</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2024/oasiscruise.jpg" alt="view of a huge Oasis cruise ship at a dock" width="675" height="395" /><br />
In my mind, there is only one cruise deal website worth following: <a href="https://cruisesheet.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CruiseSheet</a>. This site consistently has some of the lowest rates out there, and its interface is beautiful. </p>
<p>If I don’t find anything on CruiseSheet or want to double-check a price, I go to the second-best website, <a href="https://www.vacationstogo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vacationstogo.com</a>.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Where to Find the Best Transportation Deals</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2024/costaricacar2.jpeg" width="675" height="395" alt="An car driving down a dirt road towards a volcano covered in clouds in Costa Rica"><br />
If you&#8217;re looking for budget transportation, these are the websites you&#8217;ll want to check. Cheap buses, trains, and rideshare apps can help keep your transportation costs low, giving you more time on the road. Here are my favorites:</p>

For tours and excursions, I keep an eye on the following companies by subscribing to their emails:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://thenomadicnetwork.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Nomadic Network (TNN)</a> &#8211; I created this global community for travel lovers in 2019.

<h3>Where I Find the Best Travel Insurance Deals</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2024/worldnomadsannualtravelinsurance.jpg" width="675" height="395" alt="Two people with backpacks hiking across a rugged mountain trail" /><br />
I never travel anywhere without travel insurance. After dealing with injuries and emergencies abroad (and knowing plenty of other travelers who have been injured or robbed on the road) I always make sure I have comprehensive medical and travel insurance before I leave home. Here are my recommended companies for finding the best travel insurance:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://safetywing.com/nomad-insurance?referenceID=24768462" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SafetyWing</a> &#8211; This is my go-to travel insurance company. They offer affordable monthly plans with a deductible. Great for digital nomads and frugal travelers!</li>

<li><a href="https://medjetassist.com/nomadicmatt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Medjet</a> &#8211; Medjet is a good option for people who are going to be far from home and want added evacuation coverage. It’s great for solo travelers and super affordable.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-3032045-15403748" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World Nomads</a> &#8211; The first company I ever got travel insurance with, World Nomads is best for adventurous travelers. They cover a lot of adventure activities that other companies don&#8217;t, and now even offer <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-3032045-16944485" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">annual travel insurance</a>. </li>

<h4>Book Your Trip: Logistical Tips and Tricks</h4>
<p><strong>Book Your Flight</strong><br />
Find a cheap flight by using <a href="https://skyscanner.pxf.io/c/214481/1027991/13416?subId1=%26currency%3DUSD&#038;associateid=AFF_TRA_19354_00001&#038;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skyscanner.com%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skyscanner</a>.

<p><strong>Book Your Accommodation</strong><br />
You can book your hostel with <a href="https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hostelworld</a>.

<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Forget Travel Insurance</strong><br />

I never go on a trip without it as I&#8217;ve had to use it many times in the past. My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are:</p>
<ul>
