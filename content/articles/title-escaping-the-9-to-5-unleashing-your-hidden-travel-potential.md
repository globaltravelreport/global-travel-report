Alright folks, let's chat about time. You know that slippery little devil that always seems to outrun us? Yep, time. It’s like trying to catch a greased pig at a country fair—almost impossible. And when it comes to travel, it feels like we’re always left in the dust.

Now, I hear it all the time from mates who are chained to their cubicles—they pine for adventures but reckon they just don't have enough hours in the day (and let's not even mention money—that's another kettle of fish I've tackled before). But here's a newsflash—even if you can't go full-on digital nomad thanks to this pesky pandemic, there is still so much potential for exploration.

You know what? They've got it wrong; they're viewing travel through a warped lens. Let's break down those office job constraints for a moment. You work all year round but get two weeks off (If you're not from our part of the world—the U.S.—you lucky ducks might get more). Add your weekends and voila! You stumble upon an impressive total of 110 days per year ripe for adventure—four months' worth! It might be scattered throughout the year, but trust me—a lot can happen in those bits of freedom.

Hang on now... Four months? That’s right! That’s nearly one third of your entire year free and clear for making memories galore, checking off that bucket list or perhaps simply discovering your own backyard in greater depth. Now doesn’t that put things into perspective?

You see, life is all about priorities—I'm as guilty as anyone else when I say I "don't have time" for stuff like hitting up the gym (though Lord knows my beer belly tells me otherwise!). Truth is—we make time for what matters, and if travel is your thing, there's room for it. 

And let’s debunk this idea that “travel” equals some extended, bank-breaking journey to the ends of the earth. We’ve all got Hollywood and glossy travel magazines to thank for that one. Sure, they make us dream big—but they also blind us from seeing the beauty right under our noses—or a short drive away.

In reality, folks—there are plenty of ways to incorporate travel into your everyday life without breaking the bank or putting your job on hold. So, how about it? Ready to start making those 110 days count?
