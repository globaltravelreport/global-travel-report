Immerse yourself in the mesmerising charm of Lisbon, a city like no other in Europe. The Portuguese capital, with its time-worn pastel façades, ornate azulejos (painted glazed tiles), hill-climbing vintage funiculars, and a timeless, laid-back allure, has a magnetic pull. Over the last twenty years, my countless visits to this captivating city have only intensified my fascination. Although I currently reside in the Algarve, a swift train journey frequently reunites me with my cherished city. 

Spend a weekend traversing the seven hills of Lisbon, and you'll find yourself marvelling at the city in its most atmospheric form. While a weekend may not suffice to uncover all the treasures of Lisbon, it will provide a tantalising introduction that will undoubtedly leave you enchanted. Allow me to guide you through a meticulously curated three-day itinerary that seamlessly blends the city's main attractions with unexpected delights and gastronomic experiences. 

Start your adventure on a Thursday evening or bright and early on a Friday to make the most of your three-day visit. Opting for a Friday start is a wise choice as many attractions are closed on Mondays. However, if you plan to explore the palaces of Sintra, consider extending your visit to include Monday, when the crowds will be smaller. 

Lisbon Airport is conveniently connected to the city centre via the modern and efficient metro system (Red Line). A 30-minute ride costing just €1.85 (US$2.10) will transport you to the heart of the action. Taxis and rideshare services are available, but they may not always be quicker due to the city's bustling traffic. 

Walking around the city is the best way to soak in the sights and sounds of the different districts of Lisbon. The Carris buses and trams offer a scenic commute between neighbourhoods, ensuring you don’t miss any views while underground. Avoid the touristy and often crowded tuk-tuks which aren't appreciated by locals. 

Choosing the right place to stay can enhance your Lisbon experience. Consider boutique hotels like As Janelas Verdes, located in the relaxed neighbourhood of Alcântara, or the no-frills Wallis São Bento near Príncipe Real. If you prefer a dash of history, the convent-converted Hotel Convento do Salvador in Alfama is a charming choice. 

Exploring Lisbon is an adventure, so comfortable footwear is a must. The city's hilly terrain and cobblestones are not heel-friendly. Dressing in lightweight layers is advisable all year round, as the Atlantic can bring a cool breeze even in summer. 

In conclusion, Lisbon, with its old-world charm, engaging culture, and delicious culinary scene, is a city that every traveller should experience. Whether you're meandering through its charming streets, savouring traditional Portuguese cuisine, or marvelling at the city's architectural wonders, Lisbon offers an unforgettable adventure that will leave you longing for more.
