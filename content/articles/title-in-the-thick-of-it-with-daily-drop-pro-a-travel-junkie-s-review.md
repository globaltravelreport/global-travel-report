Look, I'm not one to normally gush about newsletters, but then came along Daily Drop. Crafted by my mates Kara and Nate (who also run their highly popular YouTube channel), this gem keeps you in the loop on the latest happenings in air travel, hotel updates and all things points & miles. And if that's not enough, there’s a special subscription service called Daily Drop Pro that promises an extra dose of deals, alerts and tools.

Here's where it gets really interesting though – what does this paid version actually offer? Is it worth the cost? As someone who has seen this unassuming little newsletter grow into a gargantuan resource for travellers worldwide, I decided to give it a whirl myself and see what all the fuss is about. 

Daily Drop Pro claims to be your ultimate hub for flights, hotels (paid through points or hard-earned cash), deals and generally chatting away with fellow travel enthusiasts in their forum. The main features are flight points search, hotel points search, deal alerts (very handy!), wallets and the exclusive Daily Drop Pro Lounge.

But how does it stack up against other websites promising similar services? Well mate, let me tell you – they have some nifty options that set them apart from the crowd. What sold me was its unique feature allowing preferences to be adjusted according to time of day, stops duration - even aircraft type! Talk about specifics! Plus it lets you compare cash rates which can come in handy too.

The hotel award search is something else altogether. With so many customization options based on your points and preferred programmes, there's no stone left unturned when finding your ideal place to stay while wandering our great big world.

Deal Alerts would have to be my favourite part though – these blokes list both cash deals as well as point awards sales which are an absolute pain to keep track of otherwise. You can choose your home airport, preferred travel regions and voila – let the deals sweep you off to an unplanned adventure!

In conclusion, Daily Drop Pro is a solid investment for any serious traveller. It offers a comprehensive suite of features that will make planning (and scoring deals!) for your next trip a breeze. Happy travels, folks!
