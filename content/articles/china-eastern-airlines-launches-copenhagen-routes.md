China Eastern Airlines has announced the introduction of new flight routes connecting major cities to Copenhagen, marking a significant expansion in their service offerings. This development is poised to benefit travelers by providing additional options for reaching Denmark's enchanting capital.

The new routes will facilitate smoother travel experiences for individuals looking to explore Copenhagen's rich history, vibrant culture, and stunning architecture. Known for its picturesque cobblestone streets, colorful buildings, and innovative culinary scene, Copenhagen offers a plethora of attractions that cater to a wide range of interests.

For Australian travelers, this means more straightforward access to Scandinavia, with potential for direct flights or minimal connections depending on the departure city. It's an excellent opportunity to plan a European getaway that starts or includes Copenhagen in the itinerary.

When considering a trip to Copenhagen via China Eastern Airlines, Australian passport holders should note the visa requirements for entering Denmark. For stays of up to 90 days within a 180-day period, Australians typically do not need a visa for tourism purposes in Schengen Area countries, including Denmark.

Moreover, travel insurance is always a wise consideration, ensuring coverage for medical expenses, trip cancellations, and other unforeseen circumstances. Given the current global health landscape, travelers should also stay informed about any health and safety guidelines or requirements for entering Denmark.

In summary, China Eastern Airlines' new Copenhagen routes offer a convenient gateway to explore the Danish capital. With the promise of direct flights or reduced connections, Australian travelers can look forward to discovering Copenhagen's unique charm with greater ease.
