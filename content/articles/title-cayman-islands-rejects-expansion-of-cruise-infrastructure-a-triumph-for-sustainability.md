Title: "Cayman Islands Rejects Expansion of Cruise Infrastructure: A Triumph for Sustainability"

In a significant and possibly unexpected decision, the people of the Cayman Islands have voiced their collective opinion against the proposed expansion of cruise infrastructure.

The Association for Advancement of Cruise Tourism (ACT) in Grand Cayman had made fervent attempts to get a cruise infrastructure expansion project on the ballot for 2025. However, the proposal was ultimately rejected. The ballot, held on April 30th, 2025, resulted in 64% of voters, equating to approximately 11,973 individuals, casting a 'no' vote to the question, "Should the Cayman Islands develop cruise berthing infrastructure?" A mere 5,417 voted 'yes'.

Should the proposal have been approved, the Cayman Islands would have seen the construction of two new piers capable of accommodating up to four ships simultaneously, including larger vessels, such as Royal Caribbean's Oasis-class ships. These sophisticated vessels are currently unable to dock at the existing tender-only port. The investment would have also facilitated the addition of a new cruise terminal, retail spaces, and a transport area, all aimed at attracting more significant attention from the major cruise lines.

The project was estimated to cost between $150 to $200 million, with some of the funds expected to come from Carnival Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean. However, the Cruise Port Referendum (CPR) Cayman, an activist group, voiced strong opposition throughout the campaign. They argued that current infrastructure should be improved first and that an increase in cruise ship calls could compromise the quality of life for the island's 73,038 residents.

In conclusion, the vote against the expansion of cruise infrastructure in the Cayman Islands signifies a victory for those advocating for sustainable tourism and the preservation of local quality of life. As the CPR Cayman announced on Facebook, "Caymanians support a smarter, more sustainable path forward. This is a win for our economy, our environment, and our way of life."
