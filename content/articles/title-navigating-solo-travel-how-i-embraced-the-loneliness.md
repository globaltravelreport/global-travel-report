G'day there, fellow wanderers! Picture this: It’s 2006. My backpack's stuffed to bursting, my passport’s virgin pages impatient for their first stamp, and my head? Oh boy, it's chock-full of wild imaginings about how my life on the road is going to look like. I'm not just talking about tall tales spun out by movies or glossy travel mags – no siree! I envisioned me - a regular bloke from down under, morphing into some kind of international Casanova. 

My daydreams were like scenes from a film. Sipping lattes in charming cafes while chatting up stunning waitresses who'd eagerly teach me French over glasses of wine at a swanky locals-only bar later that night. But let's cut to the present day and get real here mates; reality didn't exactly roll out as planned.

So there I am, smack-dab in the middle of this exciting journey filled with sights that would make your jaw drop and freedom that tastes as sweet as pavlova on Australia Day (or any day really). Marching to my own beat for the very first time felt exhilarating...until it didn’t. Sure enough, after several days of soaking up culture and history solo-style, something changed.
 
I missed hearing my own voice. The silence around me started feeling less meditative and more suffocating. Felt weird being alone even when surrounded by buzzing crowds in bustling cities - Can you relate? Being alone had turned into loneliness quicker than you can say "strewth!"

The absence of friendly faces made me question if it was just me or maybe these new locales weren't ringing true to those tall tales spun in films or articles I've read online? After all, where was everyone else who was s'posed to be right there with me in those travel adventures? 

And then, a little light bulb moment! I wasn't alone because of the places or people around me. It was my own fear keeping me chained to that feeling of loneliness. As someone who's naturally bit on the shy side, striking up a conversation with strangers isn’t exactly my forte – and turns out it was a bigger hurdle back in '06 when I first started trotting the globe.

The realisation hit that if I wanted to live those dreams playing out in my head, no one but myself could make them happen. You know what else I discovered? There are more solo travellers wandering this beautiful world than you might think. Plenty of folks just like you and me - craving connections, sharing stories over cold beers or hot coffees.

Believe it or not, this revelation came sitting in a hostel in good ol' Prague when someone broke the ice and started yapping away at me. At first, it felt as jarring as an off-key didgeridoo but soon enough - magic happened! It wasn't nearly as terrifying as I'd built it up to be. Turns out travellers are some of the friendliest folk around...
