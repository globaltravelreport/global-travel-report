# Explore Manila with Ease: Qatar Airways' New Codeshare Flights from Australia

For Aussie adventurers looking to soak up the vibrant culture and stunning landscapes of the Philippines, there's exciting news! Qatar Airways has teamed up with Philippine Airlines, offering seamless connections to Manila from major Australian cities. This partnership means more flight options, competitive prices in AUD, and smoother journeys to this Southeast Asian gem.

### Why Manila?

Manila, a bustling metropolis, is the perfect gateway to the Philippines' 7,000+ islands. Whether you're after the white-sand beaches of Boracay, the historic streets of Intramuros, or the culinary delights of Pampanga, Manila provides a central base for all your adventures.

### Best Times to Visit

Considering Australia's seasons, the ideal time to visit Manila is between November and April. During these months, you'll enjoy dry weather, making it perfect for beach hopping and outdoor activities. This period avoids the Philippine rainy season and Australia's summer heat, offering a pleasant escape for Aussies.

### Flight Routes and Prices

Qatar Airways offers connections from Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, and Perth to Manila, with a stopover in Doha. Prices vary, but deals as low as $1,200 AUD for a return ticket can be found with early booking. Keep an eye out for sales and use comparison sites to snag the best fare.

### Visa Requirements

Australian passport holders can enjoy the Philippines visa-free for up to 30 days, making it a hassle-free destination for short getaways or longer explorations.

### Cultural Tips and Practical Information

- **Currency:** The Philippine Peso (PHP) is the local currency. ATMs are widely available, but carrying some cash is advisable for smaller establishments.
- **Local Transport:** Manila is notorious for traffic. Opt for the Metro Rail Transit (MRT) or Light Rail Transit (LRT) for faster travel around the city. Grab (similar to Uber) is a convenient option for door-to-door service.
- **Accommodation:** From luxury resorts to budget-friendly hostels, Manila offers a range of accommodations. Booking in advance can secure better rates.
- **Cultural Etiquette:** Filipinos are warm and hospitable. A simple "salamat" (thank you) goes a long way. Be mindful of local customs, such as removing shoes before entering someone's home.

### Final Thoughts

With Qatar Airways' new codeshare flights, exploring Manila and the broader Philippines has never been easier for Australians. Affordable prices, convenient connections, and a wealth of cultural experiences await. So, why not make Manila your next holiday destination?
