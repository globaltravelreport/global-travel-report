  Qatar Airways Codeshare with Philippine Airlines for Manila Flights - Aviation

7. **Exploring Manila just got easier and more affordable for Aussies, thanks to a new codeshare agreement between Qatar Airways and Philippine Airlines. This partnership means smoother connections and more flight options from major Australian cities like Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane to the vibrant city of Manila, making it an enticing option for your next overseas adventure.**

   **Why This Matters for You**
   Flights from Australia to Manila can often be a hassle, involving long layovers and inconvenient connections. However, with this new partnership, travelers can enjoy streamlined services and potentially lower prices, with fares starting from around AUD 750 return. These prices are especially competitive during the Australian winter, which coincidentally is the best time to visit the Philippines to avoid the wet season there.

   **Travel Smart: Timing and Visas**
   Considering the Australian summer holidays? The period from December to February is ideal for visiting Manila when you can escape the Aussie heat and enjoy the Philippine dry season. Plus, Australian passport holders can relish in the ease of travel with no visa required for stays up to 30 days, making spontaneous trips even more feasible.

   **Navigating Cultural Differences and Practical Tips**
   The cultural tapestry of Manila offers a lot to Australian travelers, from its Spanish colonial architecture to its bustling markets. Be mindful of local customs, such as the Filipino practice of "pakikisama" (valuing harmony over personal gain) â€” a little respect and understanding go a long way.

   When it comes to practicalities, the Philippine Peso (PHP) is the local currency, with 1 AUD equating to approximately 38 PHP (as of the latest exchange rates). English is widely spoken, making communication relatively easy for Australians. For getting around, Manila's Jeepneys offer a unique and affordable way to see the city, though ride-sharing apps like Grab are available for convenience.

   **Accommodation ranges from budget-friendly hostels to luxury resorts, catering to all types of travelers. Prices are generally lower than in Australia, allowing you to get more bang for your buck during your stay.

   **The Bottom Line**
   The new codeshare deal between Qatar Airways and Philippine Airlines opens up a world of travel possibilities for Australians looking to explore Manila. With competitive prices, convenient travel times, and a wealth of cultural experiences awaiting, there's never been a better time to plan your Philippine adventure.
