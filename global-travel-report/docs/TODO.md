# Fix Story TypeScript Mismatches

## Current Issues

### 1. Frontmatter/Story Interface Type Mismatches

- The `gray-matter` library's output type doesn't match our `FrontMatter` interface
- Type conversion from frontmatter data to `Story` interface lacks proper type safety
- Required properties (`timestamp`, `lastModified`) not properly handled in type conversion
- Optional properties causing type narrowing issues in filter operations

### 2. Date/Timestamp Arithmetic Type Warnings

- Sorting operations on `timestamp` fields trigger TypeScript warnings
- Date arithmetic operations lack proper type guards
- Inconsistent handling of date/timestamp types across the codebase

## Potential Solutions

### Short-term Fixes

1. Add Type Assertions:
   ```typescript
   const story = {
     ...frontmatter,
     timestamp: new Date(frontmatter.date).getTime(),
     lastModified: stats.mtimeMs
   } as Story;
   ```

2. Use Type Guards:
   ```typescript
   function isFrontMatter(data: unknown): data is FrontMatter {
     const d = data as any;
     return typeof d.title === 'string' 
       && typeof d.date === 'string'
       // ... other checks
   }
   ```

### Long-term Solutions

1. Implement Runtime Type Validation:
   - Use [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) for schema validation
   - Provides runtime type safety and automatic TypeScript types
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     const FrontMatterSchema = z.object({
       title: z.string(),
       date: z.string().refine(isValidDate),
       // ... other fields
     });
     ```

2. Create Dedicated Date Utilities:
   - Implement a `DateHandler` class/module
   - Consistent date/timestamp conversions
   - Type-safe arithmetic operations

3. Refactor Story Types:
   - Split into more specific interfaces (e.g., `BaseStory`, `PublishedStory`)
   - Use discriminated unions for different story states
   - Add proper validation at data boundaries

## Implementation Priority

These issues should be addressed after the initial deployment when:
1. Core functionality is stable
2. We have real usage data
3. Performance impact can be properly measured

## Notes for Developers

- Current type warnings don't affect runtime behavior
- All date/timestamp operations are validated at runtime
- Test coverage ensures functional correctness
- Consider using TypeScript's `// @ts-ignore` sparingly for legitimate cases
