Mexico, a country teeming with vibrant culture and picturesque landscapes, offers experiences that go beyond the usual explorations of its historic sites and spectacular beaches. One such experience that remains relatively untouched by most travellers is the journey through its expanding passenger rail network. If you've visited Mexico before, you might have missed out on this unique opportunity to see the country from a different perspective.

Beginning its journey in the late 1800s under the regime of Porfirio Díaz, Mexico's rail system was a symbol of progress and modernity. Thousands of miles of tracks connected major cities and ports. However, following the Mexican Revolution and the subsequent shift in the government's focus towards highways and bus transportation, these tracks gradually fell into disrepair.

Despite this, train travel in Mexico is about more than just reaching your destination. It's about taking the time to immerse oneself in the stunning landscapes and the rich culture that Mexico has to offer. From the northern Sierra Madre mountains crossed by El Chepe, to the southern jungles navigated by the newly opened Tren Maya, these journeys offer an unrivalled view into the heart of Mexico.

El Chepe, which has been servicing the route from Chihuahua to Los Mochis since the 1960s, is an engineering marvel that cuts through Mexico's majestic Copper Canyon. Travelling on this line, you will traverse numerous bridges and tunnels, climbing from sea level to nearly 8,000 feet. The journey offers a chance to visit quaint towns like El Fuerte, sip wine in Cerocahui, or to simply stand at the edge of the platform in Divisadero, marvelling at the vast canyon below.

The recently launched Tren Maya, on the other hand, takes you on a journey through the verdant jungles of the Yucatán Peninsula. From Cancún to Palenque, this train promises breathtaking views and access to lesser-known destinations.

In conclusion, Mexico's expanding rail network offers travellers a unique opportunity to explore the country's diverse landscapes and immerse themselves in its rich culture. With new routes being planned, the allure of train travel in Mexico is only set to increase in the coming years.
