G'day, mates! We all reckon time is a slippery eel, don't we? One minute you're sipping your morning coffee, then - whoosh! - it's bedtime again. And trust me, as someone who constantly has the travel bug itching at my feet, I know how easy it is to moan about never having enough time to travel. But let me tell you something that may surprise you: you've got more time for trotting around the globe than you think.

Now, hang on a sec while I spill some facts here. Imagine this - you're working your rear off 50 weeks a year (sounds like a heck of a lot when you put it like that), and they throw in two weeks vacation for good measure. What if I told you those measly two weeks could actually turn into around four months of potential wanderlust fulfilment? You look like you don't believe me...let's do some simple maths together.

Here's how it works out: count up all those precious weekends plus your annual leave, and presto! You've just uncovered approximately 110 days worth of potential travel per year. Let that sink in for a moment...four whole months! Makes things seem less claustrophobic now, doesn’t it?

Then there's the question of what we’re doing with all this newfound free time? If anything in life has taught me one thing (aside from never drinking tequila after midnight), it’s about priorities. Sure enough, like everyone else on this spinning blue marble called Earth, there are times when I say I don’t have time to hit the gym (just between us though…that might be because the gym isn’t exactly my preferred hangout spot). The same goes for travelling—the trick is knowing where to spend our time.

See, most folks get this idea in their head that travelling equals going on some gargantuan, budget-busting trip to a land far, far away. Maybe it’s because we’re constantly being bombarded by swanky travel agencies trying to sell us the “dream vacation." But let me spill another secret – local travels can be just as rewarding!

Just picture this: with those 110 days up your sleeve, you could explore every nook and cranny of your own backyard, or take mini-vacations to places just around the corner. It might not look like an Instagram-ready Euro-trip, but hey - travel is what you make of it.

So there you have it! Like a wise man once said (or was it my old nan?), "Don't count every hour in the day. Make every hour in the day count!” Let's embrace our time and make the most out of our potential travelling days. After all, who wouldn't want four months' worth of adventures per year?
