  This article challenges the perception of lack of time being a barrier to
  travel. It demonstrates how office workers actually have more than 100
  potential travel days each year and encourages exploration closer to home.

G'day, mates! Picture this with me for a minute. An alarm clock ringing in the wee hours of your Monday morning, followed by a quick shower and a hurriedly gulped down coffee. You then drag yourself through peak hour traffic (or public transport, if you're lucky) to spend eight or more hours inside the confines of your grey cubicle. Sounds familiar? Well, let me tell ya something you may not have figured out yet...you can break free from this cycle more often than you think!

What's holding you back? Time? Money? Let's tackle the first one straight away. You're probably working about 50 weeks each year, right? Lucky ducks in Europe get way more holiday time off than we do here Down Under or over there in the good ol' US of A. So what's leftover for us after grinding away at our jobs most days?

Hang on; did you remember to count your weekends? And those precious two weeks of annual leave we all save up like gold nuggets in an old prospector’s pan. Count 'em up! That's 110 days each year when you could be exploring jungles realer than your office one - beaches too! Tack on those public holidays (cheers Queen Liz!) and sneaky long weekends and voila – even more time for adventure.

You might be picturing extravagant trips abroad that gulp down both time and money when travel is mentioned. But remember - it doesn't always have to be Paris or bust! We've been conditioned to think big equals better when it comes to travelling because hey, that's what fills travel agencies' pockets, isn't it?

COVID has definitely thrown a spanner in our big travel plans but maybe it’s taught us something valuable too. There are hidden treasures closer to home waiting to be explored – weekend road trips, camping under the stars on a clear outback night, or exploring that coastal town you've always driven past but never stopped in. You don’t need months; just a willingness to explore and make it happen.

So maybe that cubicle doesn't have to be your Monday-to-Friday prison after all. Who knows what adventures are waiting for you in those 110+ days of freedom each year? Use them wisely, mates! We're not getting any younger - as my old man used to say, “you can't take time with ya!”
