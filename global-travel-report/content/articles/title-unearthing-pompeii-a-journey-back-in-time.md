Ever as a kid, I was the one head buried in history books - those tales of lost civilisations and ancient heroes. History's my jam! Greek or Roman, it mattered little; what got me hooked was the thrill of uncovering secrets from centuries past. So, you can imagine Pompeii— that majestic city frozen by Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE — was on my must-visit list.

Now picture this: lush agricultural lands, a thriving cultural hub with public baths, an amphitheatre, temples even an advanced aqueduct system for clean water. Sounds like a paradise right? That’s what Pompeii once was before Vesuvius decided to have its fiery tantrum. In fact, at its peak, over 20k folks called this place home.

I know you’re thinking now – “But wasn’t everyone wiped out?” The ash and pumice did fall incessantly for more than 18 hours when Vesuvius erupted. While many lives were tragically lost (around 1,150 bodies have been discovered so far), it seems likely most folks bolted during the initial phase of the eruption. And yet we still don't know how many made it out alive... mysteries abound! 

In a strange way though, that volcanic wrath is why we can see Pompeii today almost as it was then – grand homes with frescoes intact and streets lined with pots just where they fell over two millennia ago. Over time people forgot about Pompei until Herculaneum (another town erased by Vesuvius) was rediscovered and curiosity led us back to our forgotten gem in 1748.

Being there felt surreal—walking through age-old streets while soaking up the history feels like stepping into another world entirely. But let's not sugarcoat things here—the poor old site has seen better days due to neglect, and I’m crossing fingers and toes that the Italian government steps in before further damage is done. Takes a whole day to see Pompeii, even longer if you're like me and want to dig into every nook and cranny of this 160-acre archaeological wonder.

So mates, if ancient history floats your boat as it does mine, get yourself over to Pompeii (It's near Naples!). I promise you'll come back with stories to regale your friends with for days. As for me? I'm off on my next adventure – who knows what forgotten treasures we might stumble upon next!
