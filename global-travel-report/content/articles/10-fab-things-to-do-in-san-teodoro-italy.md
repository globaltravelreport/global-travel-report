</p>
<p>San Teodoro has calm beaches good for families, like La Cinta, and quieter, stunning beaches like Cala Brandinchi (Little Tahiti). Here, you can visit the off-shore islands of Tavolara and Molara, which are absolutely stunning and limit visitors to keep things quiet. </p>
</p>
<p>My husband and I spent 12 days driving around Northern Sardinia, and I planned on San Teodoro being the last place we visited. We saved it for last because we knew we would be ready for some relaxation at that point, and because it&#8217;s close to Olbia, we could easily get to our ferry.</p>
</p>
<p>Although beaches are the main draw here, there are plenty of other things to do in San Teodoro to make a longer stay worthwhile. These include adventure activities in the mountains and learning about Sardiniaâ€™s Bronze Age history.</p>
</p>
<p>Whether youâ€™re planning a longer road trip around the island like me, or just want to lie on the beach the whole time, here are all the top things to do in San Teodoro, Sardinia.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best Things to Do in San Teodoro, Italy</h2>
</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Relax at the beach</h3>
</p>
<p><strong>I mean, let&#8217;s be honest &#8212; Sardinia has the best beaches in Italy, and some of the best beaches in Europe.</strong> These beaches are the reason why Italians barely visit the Caribbean!</p>
</p>
<p>Start with La Cinta Beach: my favorite beach in Sardinia, and all of Italy! This long sweep of white sand forms a crescent in the bay just north of town. Itâ€™s popular with kite surfers and is walkable from the town center.</p>
</p>
<p>During summer, you can take the Trenino Teodorino tourist train to La Cinta as well as the nearby Cala dâ€™Ambra, which sits east of the town center.Â </p>
</p>
<p>Cala Brandinchi, the beach known as Little Tahiti, is a smaller cove further north with pristine snorkeling conditions. Lu Impostu Beach sits in between these two beaches and offers gentle swimming conditions and kayak rentals. There are also several golf courses nearby. These two beaches are accessible by car or taxi â€“ itâ€™s a long walk from the closest bus stop.Â </p>
</p>
<p>Heading north, Cala Cirgolu is farthest afield. This is a mix of sand and pebbles and has some striking granite boulders which you can clamber over for scenic views of the bay. You can get there by public transit on buses 514 and 609, which take about 45 minutes.</p>
</p>
<p>Cala Ginepro is another option for a beach day south of San Teodoro. Youâ€™ll need a car to get there, but the reward is a much quieter spot to sunbathe and swim. There is also an unusual canal north of the main beach.Â </p>
</p>
<p><strong>One big piece of advice: if you want a chair and umbrella, you&#8217;ll need to get there early.</strong> Charlie and I got to La Cinta at 9:00 AM and we got the last two chairs available at the club. Keep in mind that many San Teodoro visitors reserve chairs in advance for the week or the month.</p>
</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Tavolara-Island-San-Teodoro-Italy-1024x683.jpg" alt="A walking path leading through a sandy island, with a big mountain rising in the far background." class="wp-image-38893" srcset="https://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Tavolara-Island-San-Teodoro-Italy-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Tavolara-Island-San-Teodoro-Italy-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Tavolara-Island-San-Teodoro-Italy-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Tavolara-Island-San-Teodoro-Italy-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Tavolara-Island-San-Teodoro-Italy-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Tavolara-Island-San-Teodoro-Italy-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The walking trails of Tavolara Island</figcaption></figure>
</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Visit the Tavolara and Molara Islands</h3>
</p>
<p><strong>Taking a boat tour to the islands of Tavolara and Molara is the number one activity for visitors in San Teodoro!</strong> While tourists are not allowed to land on Molara, you&#8217;ll sail close to the island, explore gorgeous spots off the mainland coast, have a few swim stops, and have time to visit Tavolara Island independently.</p>
</p>
<p>This was one of my favorite activities that I did in San Teodoro. I do recommend that you bring good sun protection, as my tour was on a zodiac &#8212; a big rubber boat with zero shade whatsoever. I was lucky to have a wide-brimmed hat and a sarong.</p>
</p>
<p>This three-hour <a href="https://www.viator.com/tours/Sardinia/Tavolara-Mini-Tour-of-the-Archipelago-from-San-Teodoro/d24293-263048P3?pid=P00056924&amp;mcid=42383&amp;medium=link&amp;campaign=things-to-do-in-san-teodoro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mini tour of the Tavolara Archipelago</a> stops at Cala Brandinchi and skirts the Capo Coda Cavallo before reaching Isola Molara to snorkel in crystal-clear waters.Â </p>
</p>
<p>The tour goes on to visit the island of Tavolara, a rugged limestone massif rising 565 meters above sea level. It looks straight out of Jurassic Park! There&#8217;s a cafe by the port, and there are some walking trails nearby. Be sure to stay on the paths, as the island is protected.</p>

</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Stroll through San Teodoroâ€™s Town Center</h3>
</p>
<p><strong>If you&#8217;re expecting a vibrant town like Alghero or La Maddalena, I think you might be a bit disappointed with San Teodoro.</strong> That said, the town center of San Teodoro is lovely for an evening stroll and some gelato.</p>
</p>
<p>As a classic seaside resort for Italians, San Teodoro has an ample selection of restaurants and hotels. I even came across a craft market one night during my visit. Staying somewhere central means you can get away without a car rental and use a mix of public transport, the tourist train, and tours for getting around.Â </p>
</p>
<p>This way, you can walk to places to eat and enjoy strolling through piazzas at dusk and soaking up the ambiance.&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Discover the Capo Coda Cavallo</h3>
</p>
<p><strong>Another popular spot for beach connoisseurs of Sardinia, Capo Coda Cavallo juts out just north of Cala Brandinchi.</strong> This peninsula has yet more gorgeous beaches and coves, including Cala Suaraccia, which is popular for kayaking.Â </p>
</p>
<p>If you have a car, you can drive all the way to the Belvedere Punta Est from where youâ€™ll see all the different types of landscapes, including mountains and sea grottos. The main beach on Capo Coda Cavallo is a long, sweeping crescent where you can go for a swim or rent a kayak.</p>
</p>
<p>The southern edge of Capo Coda Cavallo is rockier and worth checking out for the contrast. However, swimming conditions are more challenging due to the rocks.</p>
</p>
<p>You can also see Capo Coda Cavallo from a boat tour, as I did. The caves were amazing!

</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Visit the San Teodoro Lagoon (Stagno di San Teodoro)</h3>
</p>
<p><strong>If you&#8217;re interested in nature and bird life, you&#8217;ll love eeing the flamingos at Stagno di San Teodoro!</strong> Visiting this lagoon is one of the more unique things to do in San Teodoro. The birds rest at the San Teodoro Lagoon during their migration in summer.</p>
</p>
<p>Theyâ€™re usually joined by other migratory birds, although the pink creatures do think they own the place. You can visit the lagoon by taking the 514 or 609 bus from San Teodoro.</p>
</p>
<p>The best time to see the flamingos is between April and September. I would recommend visiting in the morning or in the late afternoon if possible, which allows you to avoid the intense midday sun, and is also much better for photography.</p>
</p>
<p>If you have a car, you can follow up your visit with a swim at the beaches of Lu Impostu, which is close by. (La Cinta might look even closer on Google Maps, but it&#8217;s only as the crow flies &#8212; you need to drive further to get to it.)</p>
</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Ride the Trenino Teodorino</h3>
</p>
<p><strong>If you&#8217;re in San Teodoro without a car, the Trenino Teodorino is a godsend!</strong> It&#8217;s not an actual train on tracks, but a train on wheels that carts you around town. And while kids love this train, adults love it just as much for both its practicality and its sightseeing potential.Â </p>
</p>
<p>This is a tourist train that links the main parts of town with the closest beaches of La Cinta and Cala dâ€™Ambra. Itâ€™s a lifesaver if you donâ€™t want to rent a car or deal with parking on a hot summerâ€™s day.</p>
</p>
<p>The Trenino Teodorino is in service between from June 1 until September 15. Tickets are sold on board and cost 2.50 EUR ($2.60 USD) one-way, 5 EUR ($5.25 USD) for a return, or 20 EUR ($21 USD) for a weekly pass.Â </p>

</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Go hiking, canyoning, or offroading</h3>
</p>
<p><strong>There are plenty of opportunities for an adrenaline rush in San Teodoro, including canyoning. </strong>This high-octane activity takes place in the Rio Pitrisconi around Mount Nieddu, which is also a popular area with hikers.&nbsp;</p>
</p>
<p>One very big tip first: I just want you to keep in mind that Sardinia gets VERY hot in the summer months. I wouldn&#8217;t go on a hike in midday summer unless swimming were a big part of it. Luckily, there are several tours in San Teodoro that incorporate cooling off.</p>
</p>
<p>Be sure to bring sun protection and plenty of water.</p>

</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Go biking (or e-biking)</h3>
</p>
<p><strong>Biking is another fun option for adventure in San Teodoro. </strong>The best routes follow a similar way to the canyoning tours in Rio Pitrisconi and around Mount Nieddu.</p>
</p>
<p>Once again, I recommend wearing sun protection and bringing plenty of water!</p>

The power-assisted bikes take the pressure off and the 21-mile (35 km) route isnâ€™t too demanding. It mixes asphalt roads and dirt roads cutting through the forest, which bring you to the best viewpoints.&nbsp;</p>
</p>
<p>As there are opportunities to swim in the waterfalls and pools, you&#8217;ll want to wear or bring your bathing suit.</p>

Via Shutterstock.</figcaption></figure>
</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Explore the Archaeological Sites</h3>
</p>
<p><strong>Skip the beach for an afternoon of archaeology and exploration at Nuraghe San Pietro.</strong> This <em>nuraghe</em> &#8212; a nuraghe is megalithic edifice found only in Sardinia &#8212; was built by the Bronze Age Nuragic civilization.</p>
</p>
<p>The Nuragic people constructed villages and homes by stacking slabs of stone on top of each other. In the case of Nuraghe San Pietro, the remains center around a main tower and some well-preserved fortifications.&nbsp;</p>
</p>
<p>The natural scenery around the nuraghe is incredible, and itâ€™s a unique opportunity to see ancient ruins. Itâ€™s a self-guided tour but the ticket desk does share some information about the history of the settlement.Â </p>
</p>
<p>Admission is 3 EUR ($3 USD). The location, near the small town of TorpÃ¨, is only accessible with a private car. You can easily add it into a road trip heading south from San Teodoro, or on the way back from other activities.Â </p>
</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Attend the San Teodoro Festival</h3>
</p>
<p><strong>The San Teodoro Festival honors the namesake patron saint of Teodoro in summer.</strong> I love Italian festivals honoring the local saints, and highly recommend attending a festival if you can!</p>
</p>
<p>A traditional affair through and through, this festival blends religious customs with vibrant cultural festivities for everyone to get involved.</p>
</p>
<p>This usually means a procession, a mass service at the church, performances of music and dance, fireworks, and food stalls. Itâ€™s great fun to join the revelries if your trip to Sardinia coincides.&nbsp;</p>
</p>
<p>The festival of San Teodoro typically takes place at the end of June or very early July. The exact date varies each year, so double-check before your visit. And remember that hotels tend to be booked up around the festival.Â </p>
</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Much Time to Spend in San Teodoro, Italy</h2>
</p>
<p><strong>How much time do you think you might need at a relaxing beach destination? </strong>That&#8217;s up to you! Some people come for a day, some people come for a week, and plenty of Italians set up camp here in the month of August.</p>
</p>
<p>I spent three days in San Teodoro as part of my 12-day trip to northern Sardinia. That was enough time for a beach day at La Cinta, a day on a boat trip to Molara and Tavolara, and a relaxing day at the hotel pool.</p>
</p>
<p>After more than a week of driving around Sardinia (including two flat tires in a row), I needed a few lazy days! For me, that was perfect.</p>
</p>
<p>At the bare minimum, I would recommend spending two nights in San Teodoro so you can have one real beach day. However, three days gives you time to see a lot more. You can extend your stay if you want more beach time, or if you feel inspired to tackle every item on this travel guide.Â </p>

</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Get to San Teodoro, Italy</h2>
</p>
<p><strong>Olbia, San Teodoroâ€™s nearest major city, has both an airport and a ferry port.</strong> While Charlie and I debated between flying and taking the ferry, we ultimately chose to drive from Prague and take the overnight ferry from Genoa.</p>
</p>
<p>The overnight ferry with Moby Lines was a great experience (the ship was actually Looney Tunes-themed!), our interior cabin was basic but comfortable, and I wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to travel to Sardinia by ferry again.</p>
</p>
<p>Crossings from Genoa take around 12 hours, subject to sea conditions. You can book a cabin for comfort or save money and reserve a seat. <a href="https://www.mobylines.com/crossing/ports-italy/genoa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Moby Lines</a> and <a href="https://www.gnv.it/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grandi Navi Veloci (GNV)</a> are the two main service providers and you can also book tickets through <a href="https://www.directferries.com/?dfpid=4376&amp;affid=1210&amp;rurl=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Direct Ferries</a>.</p>
</p>
<p>If you arrive by air, San Teodoro is a 30-minute drive or 45-minute bus ride from Olbia Costa Smeralda Airport (OLB). Of the three airports on Sardinia, Olbia Airport is one of the better options for regional flights as well as domestic connections from mainland Italy.&nbsp;</p>
</p>
<p>Do you need a car in San Teodoro? If all you&#8217;re going to do is lie on the beach, you don&#8217;t need a car. But if you want to explore your surroundings, a car will add GREATLY to your experience in Sardinia, as most of the nice spots aren&#8217;t accessible by public transportation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Where to Stay in San Teodoro, Italy</h2>
</p>
<p><strong>You can choose to stay right in the center of San Teodoro close to the tourist train and the restaurants. </strong>Or, choose quieter accommodation on the outskirts of town if youâ€™re planning on driving yourself around.&nbsp;</p>
</p>
<p>Either way, it&#8217;s always a good idea to check if your hotel has a shuttle to town or the beaches.</p>
</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best Time to Visit San Teodoro, Italy</h2>
</p>
<p><strong>As with most Italian beach destinations, San Teodoro gets its best weather in the summer.</strong> This is the best time to visit the Sardinian resort for beaches, seeing the flamingos, and enjoying festivals and an all-around. buzzy atmosphere.</p>
</p>
<p>On the downside, summer is the busiest and most expensive time to visit San Teodoro. I recommend aiming for early June or late September for a more peaceful experience with reliably warm weather.Â </p>
</p>
<p>I would recommend skipping August if possible &#8212; this is the peak travel month for Italians in San Teodoro, and it will be incredibly busy.</p>
</p>
<p>San Teodoro is very quiet in the off-season if you fancy a cheap getaway and wonâ€™t miss a Mediterranean dip. Just bear in mind that a lot of places will be closed and not all services will be in operation.&nbsp;</p>
</p>
<p>If you were looking for a place to visit in Sardinia in the winter, I would head to a larger city, like Alghero, which has people living in it year-round.</p>
</p>

</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is San Teodoro Worth It?</h2>
</p>
<p><strong>I really loved my time in San Teodoro, and it made the perfect relaxing end to my Sardinia road trip!</strong> La Cinta beach was an especially big highlight, and the trip to Tavolara and Molara was so interesting.</p>
</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re flying in or out of Olbia, or taking the overnight ferry in like me, I think San Teodoro makes an excellent place for the beginning or end of your trip.</p>
</p>
<p>I hope you have the best time in San Teodoro &#8212; and Sardinia!</p>
