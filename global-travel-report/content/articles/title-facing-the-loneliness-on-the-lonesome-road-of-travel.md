Ah, 2006, a time when I was quite green behind the ears but raring to explore. My noggin was buzzing with romanticised visions; popping with expectations painted by glossy magazines and Hollywood travel flicks. I envisioned myself, stepping onto foreign soil and being swept into this whirlwind adventure where every soul I met would be just as vibrant as the culture surrounding us.

Picture this - you're sat in some Parisian café, idly stirring a latte and then suddenly you're clinking wine glasses with the stunning waitress who's teaching you French in between laughter. Sounds straight out of a movie, right? Well, my naive self back then thought it'd be exactly like that. But let me tell ya', reality hit different.

First few days overseas were thrilling though! The architecture that looked magnificent in photos was standing tall right before my eyes. Unfamiliar food scents wafting through the air, sounds of a language I didn't understand... heck yeah! It felt good marching to my own beat. Yet somehow amidst all that excitement during those initial days, I sorta forgot one tiny detail - I was alone.

As the novelty started wearing off and my tongue pretty much forgot how words sounded due to lack of use, things took a turn for the gloomy side. Here’s your classic tale of aloneness morphing into loneliness; trust me folks there’s nothing poetic about that transition. So where were these so-called locals wanting to show me around? Or these other backpackers like myself looking for companionship?

I could've packed up and moved on to another city blaming it on bad luck or something silly like that but nah mate...the problem wasn’t them- it was me! Sitting around waiting for life to happen isn’t really how it works now is it? This epiphany sparked a realization that the only reason for my loneliness was me giving into fear. As an introvert, it wasn't exactly instinctual to strike up conversations with strangers. And back in '06 when I was but a travel rookie? Yeah, you could forget about it.

But then something shifted in beautiful Prague, when folks staying in the same hostel as me decided to break the ice first. It felt less daunting than I thought and made me realise - hey, there're heaps of solo travellers out there! Just like you and just like me; all looking for genuine connections and shared experiences while on their own respective adventures.

So here’s what I’ve learnt from my years on road - travelling alone doesn’t mean being alone. You might have some quiet moments but believe me when I say this: companionship is just one ‘hello’ away most times. So fight off those nerves travellers; don’t wait for your dreams to materialise by themselves. After all, life isn't meant to be something that simply unfolds around us; we've gotta dive headfirst into it!
