As a kid, I was utterly besotted with history. The more ancient it was, the better. Give me crumbling ruins and tales of emperors long past any day. I always dreamed of being an archeologist – rifling through fragments of pottery, unearthing secrets from layers of dust. Greece, Rome - you name it, my younger self was obsessed with it all.

You can imagine then why Pompeii was always on my bucket list. Buried by Mount Vesuvius' eruption back in 79 CE and immortalised under a blanket of ash - this place is literally a historical goldmine! It's like walking into a moment frozen in time; every inch telling a silent tale about life as it existed nearly two millennia ago.

Pompeii back in the day wasn't just some ghost town waiting for its imminent destruction. Nah mate, this city had its charm! Considered wealthy even by Roman standards – thanks to fertile farmlands and strategic location along key trade routes – Pompeii housed over 20k folks at its peak. It boasted an impressive cultural scene too; everything from amphitheatres to public baths and intricate aqueduct systems that are beguiling even to this day.

The eruption itself? Pure chaos! Lasting over two days with ash and pumice falling non-stop for almost 18 hours straight! While many managed to flee during the initial stage, plenty weren't so lucky... But hey, let's not get too gloomy here. That same ash helped preserve buildings, frescoes streets and other artefacts which we can marvel at today!

And did you know that Pompeii got lost over time? Only after Herculaneum (its neighbouring town also buried by Vesuvius) was rediscovered did folks start paying attention again. The first diggings started around 1748, and guess what? They're still unearthing new stuff even today! Who knows what other secrets Pompeii is still keeping?

Experiencing Pompeii takes time, patience, and a good pair of walking shoes. It's massive! We're talking about a site as big as over 160 acres here. So be ready to spend at least a full day if you really want to soak in the spirit of this once vibrant Roman society. And trust me when I say this: Every minute spent wandering around these ancient ruins is utterly rewarding.
