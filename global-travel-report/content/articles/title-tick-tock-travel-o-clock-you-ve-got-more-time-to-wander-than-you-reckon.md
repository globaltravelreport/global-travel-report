Crikey! The clock's always ticking, isn't it? Feels like a darned kangaroo in your pouch – always hopping ahead. It's the one thing everyone seems to be running out of. I often hear folks say they're so starved for minutes and hours that they can't even think about hitting the road. And sure, cash can be tight too, but let me tell you – time's a tricky bugger.

Now here's some food for thought: imagine you're working your bum off 50 weeks each year with two weeks' vacation tucked away like a secret stash of Tim Tams. Even if you're not American (and hey, you might have more holidays if that's the case!) just add up all those scrummy weekends and voila! That gives you 110 days of potential travel time each year - over a quarter of the bloomin' year!

So what's happening with all this free time then? Just sit on it like a broody chook? Nah mate, it's all about where your priorities lie really. If travelling truly tickles your fancy, you'll make it happen.

That reminds me of how I used to dodge my gym sessions (bad habit still intact). It’s not that there ain’t enough hours in the day; truth is I'd rather down an icy cold beer at the local pub than sweat it out on a treadmill. So see, we do have plenty of time after all!

The real problem is most people equate travel with grand Eurotrips or month-long luxury cruises – big-ticket items that seem as achievable as finding water in the Outback unless you've got deep pockets. That’s because society has shoved this idea down our throats that travel has to burn a hole in our wallets.

Here’s where we've got it all wrong, cobbers: travel doesn't have to be long-term or expensive. Just remember, extraordinary adventures can happen right in your own backyard too.

In the end, it's your journey, mate. So rev up that old ute of yours and follow where the bitumen leads you! Your local national park, a quaint little vineyard, or even that new fusion café downtown - there’s always something to explore if you just make it a priority!
