Ever since childhood, I was the kid with a wild imagination and a fascination for ancient history - yeah, the textbook nerd so to speak. My idea of adventure was not swinging on ropes or jumping off cliffs but unearthing tombs, discovering hidden temples in dense jungles, and engaging in passionate debates about Roman gladiators with my history teacher when I was just 13. That's me alright! 

And that's why Pompeii has forever been etched onto my explorer's bucket list. After all, where else would you find a city literally frozen in time under heaps of ash? You see, Mount Vesuvius had this infamous tantrum back in 79 CE which ended up smothering Pompeii under 4–6 meters of volcanic debris. Talk about a drama queen! But what if I told you there's more to Pompeii than meets the eye?

Before it turned into an archaeological goldmine, Pompeii thrived as an affluent provincial city bustling with over 20,000 chatty Italians. Imagine walking through lanes lined with grand villas nestled amidst verdant fields; public baths echoing with chatter; amphitheatres reverberating with applause; all supplied by an intricate aqueduct system. Now picture them silenced and buried overnight due to Vesuvius’ fiery fit.

The eruption raged on for two days – first pelting the city with pumice and ash and then burying everything under its fiery wrath. While many managed to escape during the initial phase of falling ash – we've found evidence of around 1,150 bodies – there’s no final tally on how much loss this catastrophe brought upon.

But every cloud – or in this case, volcanic eruption – has a silver lining right? The very volcanic debris that obliterated Pompeii also preserved its essence - buildings stood tall albeit covered completely in ash, frescoes maintained their vibrant colors, and the bodies lay in the exact locations as their last breath. Though some of it was looted post-eruption – humans being humans – Pompeii was eventually forgotten with time. And that's how it stayed till Herculaneum, another unfortunate victim of Vesuvius’ tantrums, got discovered and sparked interest in this area again.

I’ve gallivanted across the globe checking out ruins left, right and center but I tell you what, Pompeii takes the cake. A day here feels like an immersive trip back to Roman times. There's just so much to see! But sadly folks, time and lack of care have chipped away at its glory. It’s high time Italy puts on its thinking cap before we lose this historical gem altogether.

If you're ever in Naples (which is a stone's throw away) don't miss out on this place guys! Just ensure you've reserved a full day or even a half more if your inner Indiana Jones gets too excited - trust me on this one!
