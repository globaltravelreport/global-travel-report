Have you ever stumbled on something that changes your travel game? You know, one of those things that makes you wonder how you managed without it before? Well mate, I found mine—it's called Daily Drop Pro.

You see, my good mates Kara and Nate (the YouTube sensation duo) have created this nifty little tool. They're the brains behind a newsletter called Daily Drop, brimful with travel news, points & miles tips and juicy updates from the airline and hotel industries. But today we aren't talking about their regular freebie. Nah, let's delve into their premium service—Daily Drop Pro.

Now hold onto your sunhats folks, because this isn't just any old subscription service. It’s a passport to more deals, alerts—basically everything you need to score big in award availability for your next trip. Sounds brilliant doesn’t it? But like any rational human being—and especially as an Aussie always on the hunt for a fair dinkum deal—you’re probably wondering if it's worth parted some of your hard-earned cash with.

As I've watched Daily Drop grow bigger than Ben-Hur, I’ve had a bunch of readers asking me whether they should bite the bullet on this one so let's unpack it together.

So what’s in this treasure box named Daily Drop Pro? Picture yourself boarding a one-stop flight to every aspect of travel planning - flights & hotels (cash or points), deals galore and a buzzing community forum full of fellow wanderlusters. The goodies don't stop there though; there are five main perks to this service:

1) Flight Points Search
2) Hotel Points Search
3) Deal Alerts
4) Wallets 
5) Daily Drop Pro Lounge

Let’s take a quick squiz at these features shall we?

Flight Points Search ain’t just another tool in the shed. What sets Daily Drop Pro apart from its competitors is how you can fine-tune your results based on time of day, stops, duration, maximum points and even aircraft type (only they offer this gem). It might not be a selling point that their cash rate comparison sends you to Google Flights but hey, nobody’s perfect. 

Their Hotel Points Search feature is just as impressive, if not more. With a dearth of stiff competition in this space, Daily Drop has plenty room to shine with its extensive customization features.

And don’t get me started on the Deal Alerts. You could spend hours hunting down award fare sales or simply let them do all the hard yakka for you! Select your home airport and preferred regions and off you go!

So there it is folks—Daily Drop Pro in a nutshell. It's certainly something worth thinking about next time you're planning your travels!
