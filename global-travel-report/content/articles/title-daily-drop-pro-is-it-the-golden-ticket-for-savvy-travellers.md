Alright, fellow travellers, let's dive into a fabulous newsletter I've been following: Daily Drop. Imagine having your mates Kara and Nate (yeah, those legends from that YouTube channel you've likely stumbled upon) delivering nuggets of wisdom about points, miles, travel and credit cards right into your inbox. Sounds neat? Well, it is! They’ll get you up to speed on all the happenings in the airline and hotel world.

So here’s something interesting – they’ve spruced up their free newsletter with a premium service they call Daily Drop Pro. Promising more deals, alerts and tools to find award availability for your next trip, it makes me wonder... is its bark as big as its bite? Is it really worth the price? Not gonna lie, there's been a flurry of questions from my readers about this cheeky service so I thought I'd give my two cents on who should consider hitching their wagon to this star.

Let's cut to the chase. So what is Daily Drop Pro anyway? The lads at Daily Drop describe their brainchild as a one-stop-shop for flights and hotels (with points or cash), deals galore and a space to chinwag with other like-minded globe trotters in a community forum. It’s broken down into five main features:

- Flight Points Search
- Hotel Points Search
- Deal Alerts
- Wallets
- Daily Drop Pro Lounge

Are you itching to know more about these fab features? Hold onto your hats; we’re going on an adventure!

Flight Points Search - Yeah yeah, there are bucket loads of websites where you can search for flights using points but what makes Daily Drop Pro stand out from the crowd? You know how pedantic I can be when booking my trips (who wants an 8-hour layover?), well DD Pro lets you fine-tune your search based on time of day, stops, duration, maximum points and even aircraft type. How's that for specificity?

Hotel Points Search - This is where it gets really exciting! Daily Drop Pro allows you to dig out award space for hotels with a level of customisation that leaves other competitors in the dust. The ability to define your results based on points, programs, award certificates and which hotel programs accept transferred credit card points – splendid!

Deal Alerts - A feature that lists both points and cash deals and lets you select your home airports and preferred travel regions? Yes please! It's like having a personal shopping assistant who hands you all the best bargains without you lifting a finger.

Knocking off here but trust me, there’s heaps more to say about Daily Drop Pro. Guess we'll continue this chat over a cuppa next time.
