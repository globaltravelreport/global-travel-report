Picture this – there I was, perched on a bridge in Vienna, Austria. The sun was setting and the world felt right. Now, mind you, I wasn't born with a backpack strapped to my shoulders - becoming travel-savvy took time. Think missed buses in Paris, clumsy language mix-ups in Tokyo, and that one time I slept through an entire train ride... only to end up back where I started! But it's these little mishaps that make you grow.

You see, when you first dip your toes into the expansive ocean of travel (and yes mate, it can be as terrifying as a croc-infested creek), you're bound to stuff up here and there. Been there, done that! So why not benefit from my blunders? Over almost two decades of nomadic wanderings, I've put together 51 nuggets of wisdom that have saved me more than once.

First off - don't forget your towel! Sounds daft? Hear me out. Whether you're sunning on Bondi beach or caught in a surprise drizzle at Machu Picchu (true story!), having a compact quick-dry towel tucked away is just common sense. Plus, hostel towels can be hit or miss – sometimes literally missing altogether!

Next tip - reign in the luggage size! It's tempting to lug around everything bar the kitchen sink but let's get real; do we need half of what we pack? A small backpack forces us to pack smartly – trust me on this one. Picture lugging around an oversized bag through narrow Italian alleyways or crowded Indian trains…yikes!

And last piece of advice for now - invest in packing cubes! Ever had your undies spill out onto an airport conveyor belt while security check your bag? Yeah...packing cubes are the way to go. They're like little organisers for your bag, helping you find things quicker while keeping your clothes neatly folded.

So there you have it mates – a taste of my travel tips from years on the road. I hope these nuggets of wisdom help you navigate your own adventures with less mishaps and more enjoyment. After all, isn't that what travel is all about?
