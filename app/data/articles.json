    "content": "Japan's Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) has uncovered that representatives of Tokyo's top hotels have been sharing pricing data, leading to potential market distortion. The JFTC found that monthly meetings held by hotel executives to share information on operations may have influenced nightly rates, contravening the Anti-Monopoly Law. While the JFTC stopped short of declaring the hotels had formed a cartel, it determined that the data-sharing amounted to an unreasonable restraint of trade. The warning will be issued to 15 luxury hotels, including iconic brands such as the Imperial Hotel, New Otani, Keio Plaza, and Hotel Okura Tokyo. The Imperial Hotel stated that it is taking the matter seriously, although it has not yet received formal notification from the JFTC.",

    "summary": "Venice implements a new entry fee to deter 'eat and flee' tourists and manage overtourism, sparking debate and controversy.",
    "content": "Venice is taking a stand against 'eat and flee' tourists by reintroducing an entry fee for day-trippers who treat the city as a quick pit stop. The fee, which has seen a price hike, aims to reduce mass tourism and encourage more respectful visitor behavior. Despite some criticism and mixed results, the city officials argue that the fee has generated much-needed revenue and are expanding the fee days to manage peak crowds. While the move has sparked international interest, it has also raised concerns about Venice's cultural preservation and the impact of overtourism. As the city continues its battle to reclaim its cultural identity, visitors are advised to be prepared to pay the entry fee if they want to explore the iconic city.",
