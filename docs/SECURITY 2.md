# Security Guidelines for Global Travel Report

This document outlines security best practices and procedures for the Global Travel Report website.

## Security Measures

### 1. HTTPS Enforcement

All traffic to the Global Travel Report website is forced to use HTTPS through multiple mechanisms:

- **Content Security Policy**: The `upgrade-insecure-requests` directive forces browsers to use HTTPS for all requests
- **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**: The `Strict-Transport-Security` header tells browsers to only use HTTPS
- **Secure Cookies**: All cookies are set with the `Secure` flag to ensure they're only sent over HTTPS
- **HTTPS-only Resources**: All external resources (images, scripts, etc.) are loaded over HTTPS

### 2. Content Security Policy (CSP)

A comprehensive Content Security Policy is implemented to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks:

- **Nonce-based CSP**: Each page gets a unique nonce for script execution
- **Strict CSP Rules**: Only allow resources from trusted domains
- **CSP Reporting**: Violations are reported to a monitoring endpoint
- **Frame Protection**: Control which sites can embed our content

### 3. CSRF Protection

Cross-Site Request Forgery protection is implemented for all state-changing operations:

- **CSRF Tokens**: Unique tokens are generated for each session
- **Token Validation**: All POST, PUT, and DELETE requests require a valid CSRF token
- **Same-Site Cookies**: Cookies are set with `SameSite=Strict` to prevent CSRF

### 4. Input Validation

All user input is validated and sanitized:

- **Server-side Validation**: Using Zod schemas
- **Client-side Validation**: For immediate feedback
- **Output Encoding**: All user-generated content is properly encoded before display

### 5. Authentication and Authorization

- **Secure Password Storage**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- **Rate Limiting**: To prevent brute force attacks
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with proper timeouts

### 6. Regular Security Audits

Security audits are conducted regularly to identify and fix vulnerabilities:

- **Automated Scans**: Run the security audit script weekly
- **Dependency Checks**: Regular checks for vulnerable dependencies
- **Manual Code Reviews**: Security-focused code reviews for all changes

## Security Audit Procedure

1. **Weekly Automated Checks**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/security-audit.js --report
   ```

2. **Monthly Comprehensive Audit**:
   - Run the security audit script
   - Review the generated report
   - Check for new vulnerabilities in dependencies
   - Review access logs for suspicious activity
   - Test authentication and authorization controls

3. **Quarterly External Review**:
   - Engage with security professionals for an external review
   - Conduct penetration testing
   - Update security policies based on findings

## Security Headers

The following security headers are implemented:

| Header | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `Content-Security-Policy` | Prevents XSS attacks by controlling resource loading |
| `Strict-Transport-Security` | Forces HTTPS connections |
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | Prevents MIME type sniffing |
| `X-Frame-Options` | Controls iframe embedding |
| `X-XSS-Protection` | Additional XSS protection |
| `Referrer-Policy` | Controls referrer information |
| `Permissions-Policy` | Restricts browser features |

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose the issue publicly**
2. Email the security team at security@globaltravelreport.com
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Wait for a response before disclosing the issue

## Security Best Practices for Developers

### Code Security

1. **Avoid Dangerous Functions**:
   - Never use `eval()` or `Function()`
   - Avoid `innerHTML` when possible, use `textContent` instead
   - Don't use `document.write()`

2. **Secure Data Handling**:
   - Never store sensitive data in client-side storage
   - Use environment variables for secrets
   - Implement proper error handling to avoid information leakage

3. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - Always verify user permissions for each request
   - Implement the principle of least privilege
   - Use secure session management

### Dependency Management

1. **Regular Updates**:
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm update
   ```

2. **Minimize Dependencies**:
   - Only add dependencies when necessary
   - Review the security history of packages before adding them

3. **Lock Dependencies**:
   - Use package-lock.json to lock dependency versions
   - Consider using npm shrinkwrap for production

## Security Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Contain**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Eradicate**: Remove the cause of the breach
3. **Recover**: Restore systems to normal operation
4. **Learn**: Document the incident and improve security measures

## Compliance

The Global Travel Report website follows these security standards:

- OWASP Top 10
- GDPR requirements for data protection
- Industry best practices for web security
