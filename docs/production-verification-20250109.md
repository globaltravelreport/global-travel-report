# Global Travel Report — Production Verification Audit (January 9, 2025)

## Executive Summary

| Category | Grade | Status Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Secrets | Incomplete | External webhook validation and CI secret scanning checks blocked by network restrictions; no new evidence gathered. |
| Broken Links & Assets | Incomplete | Unable to crawl live site or capture HAR exports without outbound network access. |
| Robots & Indexing | Incomplete | Robots.txt retrieval blocked; no confirmation that asset paths are crawlable. |
| Structured Data | Incomplete | JSON-LD validators require outbound HTTP; evidence could not be refreshed. |
| Sitemap & Navigation | Incomplete | Footer sitemap target not revalidated due to crawl limitations. |
| Type Safety & Builds | **F** | `npm run typecheck` fails with 31 TypeScript errors across 16 files. |
| Dead Code | Incomplete | Static analysis tooling for import graphs not executable offline; previous duplicate findings remain unresolved. |
| Accessibility | Incomplete | Axe scans on live pages could not be executed without browser access. |
| Security | Incomplete | Probing admin and cron endpoints requires live HTTP access that is currently unavailable. |
| Performance | Incomplete | Lighthouse runs (mobile + desktop) blocked by lack of Chromium and live connectivity. |
| Scalability | Incomplete | Load testing endpoints and cron jobs requires live environment connectivity; not attempted. |
| Compliance | Incomplete | Cookie-consent and analytics capture cannot be verified offline. |
| RSS & Offline | Incomplete | Feed and offline asset validation blocked by inability to fetch live resources. |

**Overall Repository Health:** **F** — Critical TypeScript failures remain, and no new production evidence could be gathered due to environment restrictions. Immediate focus should be resolving the typecheck blockers and re-running the full live-site verification from a network-enabled environment.

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Secrets — Grade: Incomplete
- **Blocked Checks:** Running gitleaks with a planted token, exercising the "old" Make webhook, and confirming CI behavior all require outbound HTTP to GitHub and Make. The current container forbids such calls, so no new proof of rotation or scanner behavior is available.
- **Recommended Action:** Re-run the full secrets workflow from a workstation with outbound access; include command logs, screenshots of the rejected webhook call, and CI evidence showing gitleaks failing on an injected credential.

### 2. Broken Links & Assets — Grade: Incomplete
- **Blocked Checks:** Site crawling, HAR capture, and asset verification need live HTTP fetches. The environment cannot reach `https://globaltravelreport.com`, so no refreshed crawl export or HAR files could be produced.
- **Recommended Action:** Use `site-inspector` or Playwright with network access to crawl the homepage and two most recent stories, collecting full HAR exports and enumerating all 404/500 responses with referers.

### 3. Robots & Indexing — Grade: Incomplete
- **Blocked Checks:** Fetching `/robots.txt` from live is not possible offline, preventing validation that JS, CSS, and JSON are crawlable.
- **Recommended Action:** Retrieve the live robots file and confirm no disallow rules block render-critical assets; capture the response headers as evidence.

### 4. Structured Data — Grade: Incomplete
- **Blocked Checks:** Google Rich Results Test and other validators require network access. JSON-LD snippets on home, category, and article pages could not be validated or compared for duplicate entities.
- **Recommended Action:** Run Rich Results tests for representative URLs, archive validator output, and highlight any duplicate `Organization` entries or missing logos.

### 5. Sitemap & Navigation — Grade: Incomplete
- **Blocked Checks:** Clicking the footer sitemap entry and verifying the destination requires live navigation that is not available.
- **Recommended Action:** Confirm whether the footer link resolves to `/sitemap.xml` (or equivalent) and capture a screenshot/HAR proving the HTTP 200 response.

### 6. Type Safety & Builds — Grade: **F**
- **Command:** `npm run typecheck`
- **Result:** TypeScript reports **31 errors across 16 files**, including invalid JSX usage, missing modules (e.g., `@/lib/affiliateLinks`), and incorrect Radix Select props.
- **Evidence:** See terminal output in chunk `fccc12†L1-L97`.
- **Recommended Action:** Resolve each compiler error, re-run the command until it passes, and ensure CI enforces `npm run typecheck` with tests included.

### 7. Dead Code — Grade: Incomplete
- **Blocked Checks:** Import-graph analysis and duplicate component detection rely on tools (e.g., `ts-prune`, `depcruise`) that require full node module resolution and, in this workflow, outbound package installs not currently available.
- **Recommended Action:** Execute the dead-code tooling locally, document duplicate modules (e.g., the parallel daily story processor services previously identified), and provide delete recommendations.

### 8. Accessibility — Grade: Incomplete
- **Blocked Checks:** Running Axe on live pages requires a browser session. Without it, form-label verification and Enter-key submission checks for the newsletter cannot be revalidated.
- **Recommended Action:** Use Playwright + axe-core or the Axe browser extension on both the homepage and newsletter section, capturing violation reports and screenshots.

### 9. Security — Grade: Incomplete
- **Blocked Checks:** Testing admin endpoints, forging cookies, and hitting cron routes all require HTTP access. CSP inspection also depends on live responses.
- **Recommended Action:** From a secure environment, probe each endpoint anonymously and with forged cookies, record status codes, and capture response headers showing the Content Security Policy.

### 10. Performance — Grade: Incomplete
- **Blocked Checks:** Lighthouse audits (mobile/desktop) and layout-shift investigations cannot run without Chromium and live page access.
- **Recommended Action:** Execute Lighthouse via `lhci` or Chrome DevTools, archive JSON reports and screenshots, and document any client-side image swaps affecting LCP/CLS.

### 11. Scalability — Grade: Incomplete
- **Blocked Checks:** Load testing story list/generator APIs and assessing latency distributions require live endpoints and appropriate tooling (e.g., k6, Artillery), which are unavailable here.
- **Recommended Action:** Perform scripted load tests from an environment with permission to hit production APIs, capturing latency histograms and error rates.

### 12. Compliance — Grade: Incomplete
- **Blocked Checks:** Verifying GA deferral until consent and opt-out behavior depends on observing live network traffic in a browser; this is not possible offline.
- **Recommended Action:** Run a monitored browser session that records network activity before and after consent to prove analytics gating and opt-out persistence.

### 13. RSS & Offline — Grade: Incomplete
- **Blocked Checks:** Validating the RSS feed and offline page assets requires fetching URLs, which is blocked. No validator outputs could be captured.
- **Recommended Action:** Use the W3C feed validator and offline manifest checks to confirm all referenced logos/images resolve; attach validator logs.
